    """
    Compute the betweenness centrality for all vertices of the graph G.
    Betweenness centrality is a measure of the number of shortest paths that
    pass through a vertex.  A vertex with a high betweenness centrality score
    has more paths passing through it and is therefore believed to be more
    important.

    To improve performance. rather than doing an all-pair shortest path,
    a sample of k starting vertices can be used.

    CuGraph does not currently support the 'endpoints' and 'weight' parameters
    as seen in the corresponding networkX call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_graph: cuGraph.Graph
        The graph can be either directed (Graph(directed=True)) or undirected.
        Weights in the graph are ignored, the current implementation uses a parallel
        variation of the Brandes Algorithm (2001) to compute exact or approximate
        betweenness. If weights are provided in the edgelist, they will not be
        used.
    
    k : list or (dask)cudf object or None, optional (default=None)
        If k is not None, use k node samples to estimate betweenness.  Higher
        values give better approximation.  If k is either a list or a (dask)cudf,
        use its content for estimation: it contain vertex identifiers. If k is None
        (the default), all the vertices are used to estimate betweenness.  Vertices
        obtained through sampling or defined as a list will be used as sources for
        traversals inside the algorithm.

    normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
        If True normalize the resulting betweenness centrality values

    endpoints : bool, optional (default=False)
        If true, include the endpoints in the shortest path counts.
    
    random_state : optional (default=None)
        if k is specified and k is an integer, use random_state to initialize the
        random number generator.
        Using None defaults to a hash of process id, time, and hostname
        If k is either None or list: random_state parameter is ignored

    Returns
    -------
    betweenness_centrality : dask_cudf.DataFrame
        GPU distributed data frame containing two dask_cudf.Series of size V:
        the vertex identifiers and the corresponding betweenness centrality values.

        ddf['vertex'] : dask_cudf.Series
            Contains the vertex identifiers
        ddf['betweenness_centrality'] : dask_cudf.Series
            Contains the betweenness centrality of vertices

    --------
